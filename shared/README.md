# Samplestack "shared" Directory

> The shared directory is where code that is or may be applicable to more than one tier can be stored.

The shared directory includes:

- Javascript/Gulp-based development automation code [js/dev-tasks](./js-dev-tasks/)')
- Build options/parameters for runtime (for JavaScript, exposes as [js/options.js](./js/options.js))

In the future, it may also house parameter/options declarations which are used by tiers implemented in other languages such as Java and Groovy.
