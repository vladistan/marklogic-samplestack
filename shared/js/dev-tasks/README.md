### Browser Build Process

The build process for the browser webapp is automated in the `browser/dev-tasks` directory.

The code in this directory has evolved along with the [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp), the task-runner that is being used.

At the present time, this code isn't well-documented nor is it intended to be modified.  For instructions on the tasks that are supported, please see the [browser README](../README.md).
